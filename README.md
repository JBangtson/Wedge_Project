# Notes
In this data engineering project, I analyzed point-of-sale (POS) data from the Wedge Co-Op in Minneapolis, spanning January 2010 to January 2017. The dataset captures transaction-level details from a member-owned cooperative, with 75% of transactions generated by member-owners, enabling comprehensive shopping pattern analysis.
